# Special-Projection-Interface-Device-for-Enhanced-Routing-SPIDER-
SPIDER project deals with simplifying directions to the destination on a small part of the screen of a carâ€™s wind shield with the use of a mini inexpensive projector to aid the driver (especially in developing nations).

MOTIVATION
In urban areas, local commuting is mostly done using automobiles comprising of cars and motor cycles. With complex road networks, it becomes essential to use a device (smart phone or tablet) for viewing routes on the Global Position System (GPS) to reach the destination. However repeated looking at the device (such as smart phone/tablet) while driving becomes risky and cumbersome for safety reasons.

ABOUT PROJECT
SPIDER projects processed images (only arrows) on a small part of the car's windshield to aid the driver in not viewing the cellphone/tablet (GPS device) multiple times to find directions to a destination.

Details of the project can be viewed on the paper presented at IEEE ICACCI'14:
